## Design

This library utilizes the official `postman-code-generators` package
Utilizing this package we can generate code automatically from a defined postman collection json

This could be expanding to support any and all languages that `postman-code-generators` supports

We could also fork `postman-code-generators` and bring it into our project and extend on the already defined mechanisms within Postman
